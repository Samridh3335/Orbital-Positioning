# Orbital-Positioning
The code is iterated to calculate the final position of a body in a given orbit when the initial position and velocity at the corresponding position is known and the time elapsed between the successive position change in known. The primary outline of the code are given as follows:
- The code is iterated in MATLAB.
- Initial position and velocity at the given coordinates should be known for the analysis.
- The vectors are plotted and considered over i-j-k plane.
- Universal Values are considered in reference to Earth.
- Error Rate for iterative scheme is taken to be 1e-09.
